# React + Redux starter

This project includes a basic starter boilerplate for our React + Redux +
React Router projects, using webpack as a build system and babel for
transpilation.

## Getting Started


```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Browse to `http://localhost:9000`.

## Development

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a webpack dev server with hot reloading at
`http://localhost:9000`.

## Production

```
npm run build
```

This will build and uglify files to `dist/` ready to push to production.
