This project includes a basic starter boilerplate for our Redux + React + React-router projects, using webpack as a build system and babel for transpilation.

Be sure to `npm install` first.

* react - for rendering

* redux - for state management
* react-redux - for react + redux
* redux-devtools - TODO: not configured yet
* redux-logger - for state logging
* redux-thunk - for async actions
* react-hot-loader - for them hot loadzz.
* webpack - to build it
* babel - to transpile es6

## Development

2. `npm run dev` will start a hot reload server at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Production

2. `npm run build` will build and uglify files to `dist/` ready to push to production.

### Todos:

* Add in react-redux-router over the top of react-router
* Configure (and update) redux-devtools
